## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

- Enable **CORS** on backend to allow React frontend requests  
- Store secrets in `.env` (never commit them)  
- Use password hashing (bcrypt) for users  
- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent NoSQL injection  
- Use HTTPS in production

---

## 🚀 Deployment Tips

- Use **MongoDB Atlas** for a hosted database  
- Host backend on **Render / Railway / AWS / Heroku**  
- Host frontend on **Netlify / Vercel** (or serve static build from backend)  
- Configure environment variables in your hosting platform  
- Set up basic CI/CD for automated deployments
